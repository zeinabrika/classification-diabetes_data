Diabetes as one of the harmful diseases is important to be predicted and cure. And it is happened because of increasing sugar or glucose in the blood. 
There is a survey that shows 382 million people in the world are suffering from diabetes. The rise in machine learning methods makes process data easier than before.
Nowadays, most of the studies are working to build a model that can predict diabetes in early stages with high accuracy. 
Machine learning algorithms and classification algorithms can help researches to design models to predict diseases.


The datasets include different variables (independent) and the outcome variable (dependent). 
Independent variables are the number of pregnancies the patient has had, BMI, insulin level, age, glucose, skin thickness, etc. 
The dataset can be uploaded from the data world or Kaggle, but the source of the dataset is the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
In this dataset, all patients are a woman and at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. 
One of the interesting variables is Diabetes Pedigree Function or Pedi that includes data of diabetes mellitus history of genetic relativeâ€™s patients. 
Based on observations it is not clear how to satisfy this function for predicting the onset of diabetes.

Dataset includes:

1-The pregnancy and age variables are integers.

2- The population is young, less than 50 years old.

3-Some variables have a zero-value cause to be errors in the dataset.

As a whole, the dataset involved 768 patients, which is 268 cases were diagnosed with diabetes. 
Outcome is dependent binary variable (1 = diabetes is diagnosed, 0 = otherwise).
